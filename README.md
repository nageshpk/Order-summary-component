## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project wwas made using basic HTML and CSS flexbox. Few things I had to learn were applying shadow effects, and how to resize .svg images. Have attached code snippets below.


```css
background-size: cover;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
box-shadow: 0 0 25px -10px hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
line-height: 25px;

button:hover {
    background-color: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
